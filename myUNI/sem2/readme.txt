Here I store programs from 1st year 2nd semester of my studies. 

Programs written in C++:
    sieveOfEratosthenes.cpp - using list structure and Erastothenes algorithm find prime numbers in a range from 0 to n
    heapAdding.cpp - adds two numbers simulating how does heap work and storing the outcome in 3rd heap
    sortingBtree.cpp - using quicksort and merge sorts two files and puts them in Btree structure
