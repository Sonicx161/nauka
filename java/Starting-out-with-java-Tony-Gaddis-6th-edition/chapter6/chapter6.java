    6.1 to store data
    6.2 operations that an object can perform
    6.3 it describes how objects can be created and how they can look like
    6.4 in java API
    6.5 creates an object
    6.6 addresses
    6.7 you use reference variable to hold on object and control it
    6.8 class
    6.9 object
    6.10 object's address
    6.11 string object? i don't understand this question
    6.12
    a. car  b.make and yearModel    c.setMake, setYearModel, getMake, getYearModel
    d. just fields  e. just methods
    6.13 limo.setMake(Cadillac);
    6.14 creates new instance of class
    6.15 accessor is a member that can only get a value and mutator can store or change data
    6.16 it's a data that wasn't updated when values that were a part of it changed
    6.17 r1 L:5.0 w:20.0    r2 L:10.0 w:15.0
    6.18 sane as class
    6.19 contructor doesn't have a return type
    6.20 a. ClassAct    b. ClassAct name = new ClassAct(25);
    6.21 different parameter lists
    6.22 it is a method to distinguish overload methods
    6.23 This is the second version and then This is the first version
    6.24 one
    6.25 it is a desciption of a real-world problem 
    6.26 someone who understands the nature of a problem
    6.27 if they are noun, pronouns or noun phrases
    6.28 knowing and doing "things" very bad bad things...
    6.29 what must the object of this class know and what must this class do
    6.30 NO!

    1. a. 2. b. 3. d.
    4. c. 5. b. 6. a.

    16.T  17.F  18.F
    19.F
    
    find the error
    1. constructor doesn't have return value type (in this case 'void')
    2. wrong return type and all parameters have to have declared types
    3. no parentheses after second Rectangle();
    4. you can't declare two constructors with same parameter list
    5. second method returns wrong type
    
    algorithm workbench
    4.
    class customer fields: customerName, balance, interestEarned
    methods: deposit, withdraw, interestEarned, setBalance
    class account fields: account type, interest rate
    methods:  setAccount type, setInterestRate
    
    short answer
    1. class is a class and an instance is an object
    2. blueprint
    3. accessor can read and mutator can store and change values
    4. it is to secure unwanted access from code outside the class
    5. methods in the class
    6. to create an instance of a class
    7. ???
    8. because they can set first value
    9. if there isn't written any other constructor
    10. no-arg constructor
    11. by their parameter lists
    12. it gives more possibilities of usage
